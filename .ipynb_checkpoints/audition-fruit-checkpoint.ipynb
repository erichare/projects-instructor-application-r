The key mathematical concept here is the idea of *distance*, to quantify how different (or similar) two observations are to one another. In this project, you will explore the computation of distances using several methods, including those designed for numeric, categorical, and mixed data.\n",

    "A basic knowledge and comfort with R programming is a must. In addition, knowledge of matrix operations is a plus. We will be using R along with several companion packages such as cluster, dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot2. The primary function we will be working with is the dist() function from base R, as well as the daisy() function from the cluster package. Finally, comfort with the tidyverse series of packages and the pipe operator is a plus.\n",

Our instinct might be to compute the differences for each numeric variable, and see which one has the biggest difference. But one issue with this approach is that the variables are not always on the same *scale*. For example, *Fiber* is in grams, but Vitamin A is in milligrams. And Calories is in an entirely different unit altogether. How can we determine the variable upon which they truly are the most different?\n",
