In this project, we perform a full cluster analysis, beginning with the raw data. We proceed by deriving features used for the clustering, before performing a clustering and assessing the results with visualization techniques. Finally, we name and interpret the resulting clusters.\n",

We are going to focus on the behavior on **online gamblers** from a platform called <a href=\"https://www.bustabit.com\" target=\"_blank\">Bustabit</a>. There are a few basic rules to playing a game of Bustabit:\n",

    "\n",
    "1. You bet a certain amount of money (in Bitcoin), and you win if you cash out before the game **busts**.\n",

    "3. The multiplier increases as time goes on, but if you wait too long to cash out, you may bust and lose your money.\n",
